Send an Analog signal by encoding it using various techniques and then decoding it on the reciever side to get a digital signal

Simulate Analog to Digital encoding and decoding scheme using socket programming on two different computers. One computer will act as sender and another will be receiver. The sender will take a stream of amplitude values of an analog signal in random intervals and convert into digital data. The conversion technique (PCM/DPCM/Delta Modulation) will be taken as an input. However sampling will be done in a fixed interval. This digital data has to be converted into Manchester signal and this signal (in terms of amplitude value) will be sent to the receiver and this computer will decode the analog signal.
